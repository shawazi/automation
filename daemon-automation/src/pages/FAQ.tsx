              How to pronounce "daemon"? What is a daemon?

              "Daemon" is pronounced as "demon" (not "day-mon"). The word has fascinating origins and meanings in both computer science and literature:

            <Typography paragraph>
              In computer science, a daemon is a background process that runs without direct control from an interactive user. The term was coined by the programmers at MIT's Project MAC, inspired by Maxwell's demon, an imaginary being from a thought experiment in physics. These programs are essential for system operations, quietly handling tasks like scheduling, logging, and network services.

            <Typography paragraph>
              In Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" series, d√¶mons (spelled with a ligature) are physical manifestations of a person's inner self or soul, taking the form of animals. While this meaning differs from the technical usage, both contexts share themes of companionship and essential support, extending the capabilities of a human being.
